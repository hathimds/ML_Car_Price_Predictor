# 🚗 Secondhand Car Price Predictor — End-to-End ML Project

This project demonstrates a **complete machine learning pipeline**, from **business understanding to deployment**, by building a **Secondhand Car Price Predictor** using Python, Flask, and machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Introduction & Workflow
The goal of this project is to predict the selling price of a secondhand car based on its features (brand, model, mileage, fuel type, etc.).  

**Workflow:**
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
6. Data Splitting
7. Model Training
8. Model Tuning
9. Model Evaluation
10. Model Testing
11. Application Development (Flask)
12. Deployment (Render)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Brand
- Model
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine specifications
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Selling price (target variable)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicates
- Fixed data types
- Handled missing values
- Standardized categorical entries

---

## 📊 Descriptive Data Analysis
- Summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables
- Visualizations to understand data distribution

---

## 🔗 Correlation Analysis
- Computed correlation matrix
- Created heatmaps to identify relationships between features and target

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
- Scaled numerical features
- Prepared final feature set for model input

---

## ✂️ Data Splitting
- Train-test split to ensure unbiased model evaluation

---

## 🤖 Model Training
- Trained multiple regression models
- Selected the best-performing algorithm for deployment

---

## 🔧 Model Tuning
- Hyperparameter optimization to improve performance

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 🧪 Model Testing
- Tested on unseen data to validate generalization

---

## 🖥 Build Application
- Created a **Flask web application** for user interaction
- HTML & CSS frontend to capture input and display predictions

---

## 🌐 Model Deployment
- Deployed the Flask app on **Render**
- Configured `gunicorn` for production
